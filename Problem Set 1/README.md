Most of my answers and the instructions on how to run the necessary programs are in the "README.txt" files in the direcotries 
for each question.

In 1 I have a pdf of the analytic derivation of the composite numerical derivative and the optimal deltas.

Don't hesitate to contact me or give me feedback if this is not a format you would like me to keep, or if there are things 
I could/should improve. 

Thanks for your time and effort!
Best regards,
Damien Pinto (260687121).
