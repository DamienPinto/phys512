    What I want: a filter the size of the original space in terms of number of cells.
    This filter plots a potential of 1/r where r = 0 is the center of the space.
    The fuzz dist is the distance under which we set the potential do a constant as to avoid huge values.

    This will most-likely be a relatively costly computation, so better reduce the number of times it needs to be done.
    I think it should only be required once at the beginning of the sim, during the  setup.
